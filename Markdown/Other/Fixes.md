## Inputs

### Trackpads
- If they vibrate weird, make sure that the screws holding them aren't loose or over tightened

### Triggers
- If they rub against the backplate, make sure the shoulder buttons, triggers and the backplate are correctly installed
    - Backplate is "popped in" correctly on all sides
    - Smallest gaps possible between parts
    - No loose parts
    - Tighten screws

## Sound
- LCD Deck's internal microphone doesn't work when something is plugged into the 3.5mm audio port
    - May be "fixable" by using a TRRS adapter or some other tweaks, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/x57uh9/steam_deck_hardware_can_use_35mm_headphones_and/)

## Storage
- If it shows incorrect size:
    - Make sure the OS is fully updated
    - Make sure the drive is partitioned correctly

## OLED Audio Board (Crackling / Static Noise From 3.5mm Headphone Jack)
- Insulate screws and bottom of the audio board
- Buy new revision from iFixit
- RMA and get it repaired
