## [Official Resources made by Valve / Steam](./Official_Resources.md)

## Is The Steam Deck A Good Choice For You?:
- Pricing
    - Most likely the Deck will be the cheapest option new if you want a handheld
    - It's worth looking for sales or on the used market to see what the competition is going for as well
- Hardware / Performance
    - Valve has said many times that they will iterate slower with the Deck compared to the competition
    - Newer AAA games are already pushing the limits or barely run at all (poor optimization and "weak" hardware don't mix together well)
    - Lacking features:
        - External GPU support (without tinkering)
        - Variable refresh rate display
        - 2nd USB port
- Game / Software Compatibility (SteamOS / Linux vs Windows)
    - Not all software is available or works under SteamOS (Linux)
        - Competitive games that have anti-cheats most likely don't work (eg. Call Of Duty, Fortnite)
        - Under SteamOS specifically flatpaks are the way to go limiting your choices even more (immutable distro)
    - Modding games might be harder (specifically non-Steam-Workshop modding)
    - Frame-generation isn't that good on Linux yet
- Need for portability
    - If it would be mostly docked a console or a PC might be a better choice
- Other uses
    - Media consumption, doing work etc...
        - Might benefit from a larger screen, built in keyboard or more ports which the Steam Deck lacks (unless a hub / dock is used)
