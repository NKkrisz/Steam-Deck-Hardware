        - Gets firmware updates from Valve
        - Comes with another Steam Deck charger
        - Most likely needs an adapter if used with a case on (USB extension or fitment fix)
        - Example adapter: [Project Killswitch - Steam Deck Dock Adapter From Dbrand](https://www.printables.com/model/411302-project-killswitch-steam-deck-dock-adapter)
    - Any brand should work but it's recommended to at least have USB-C PD (Power Delivery) so the Deck remains charged
- Cases
    - Stock / Original (Older ones had strap, different models are differently colored, 1TB OLED has a removable inner case)
